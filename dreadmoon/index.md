{{ABOUT}}

DreadMoon is a first-person shooter set in a dark fantasy world with a campaign mode and a variety of multiplayer modes, developed by FatalFox Studios, LLC.

### Juicing Up the Game

I joined the team as a Technical Artist to help refresh the existing UI, but I quickly found myself working across the board to improve the game's visuals and performance. This including creating new visual effects and shaders, optimizing and improving existing ones, implementing more dynamic menus, and plenty of scripting to ensure everything was easily implemented and looked its best.

### Menu Refactoring

While working on the revamped visuals for the game's UI, frustrations with the existing menu system led me to refactor it to be as simple and modular as possible, while also minimizing the effort needed to retain its original functionality. By only replacing the functions for selection in Menu subclasses, doing this, while also making additional features like transitions and animations easier to implement, was a straightforward process.

### Shaders & Visual Effects

Although some visual effects had already been created, they made use of multiple passes and were not optimized for performance. My role was to optimize and improve the visuals of these effects, and in many cases, I reduced the number of passes needed to achieve the same effect down to one. This not only improved the game's performance, but also allowed the environment artist to increase the lived-in feel of the world with an increased variety and density of effects.
