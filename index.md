# About {{FIRST_NAME}}

### Hello!

I'm a __game tool programmer__ and __technical artist__ with __{{YEARS_WORKED}} years of professional experience in Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine__, and over {{GAME_DEV_YEARS}} years of personal experience before that, creating applications for __PC, web, and mobile__.

I take pride in making my code clear and modular and my tools as user-friendly as possible, and I'm always looking for ways to improve them. I have experience with a variety of systems, including [Steamworks APIs,](https://wiki.facepunch.com/steamworks/) [Unity's Input System,](https://unity.com/features/input-system) [Rewired,](https://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/) [A* Pathfinding Project,](https://arongranberg.com/astar/) and [DOTween,](http://dotween.demigiant.com) and can easily adapt to anyone's workflow.

With my experience including __AI pathfinding, game input, animation/audio implementation, sound design, 3D modeling, shader creation, and UI design/implementation__, I can quickly put together expandable, performant prototypes and tools for other departments to get their assets implemented.
