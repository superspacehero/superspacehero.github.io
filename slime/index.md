{{ABOUT}} Climb up flowers and signposts, jump to avoid hungry frogs, and beware the mysterious Squirlid...

Slime was made by a team of 2 in 48 hours for the GM48 game jam in the Spring of 2017.

### Automatic Movement

Your snail automatically moves forwards. If you bump into an object, you'll turn around and move in the opposite direction.
