{{ABOUT}}

Teacher Teacher was funded by USAID and Health & Development International, and was developed by Nam ER Technology, LLC.

### Expanding the Game

I joined the team as they were getting ready to expand on the game. The original system for careers and loading minigames was not easily extensible and relied on too many other classes for expansion to be feasible, so I wrote a new, extensible system with a much simpler workflow for the team to use.

### Improving Story Mode

As the game began development without a Story Mode, the system in place was difficult to use and built on top of many existing classes that made working with cutscenes an overly-complicated process. I wrote a new system to make it much easier to create cutscenes, add events to them, and even add questionnaires to the end of a career.

### Hinglish Localization

As the game was originally intended for girls in India to learn about career options, the game needed to be able to toggle between English and Hinglish (a blend of the Hindi and English languages). I wrote and implemented a system for this that made it easy to add to every text element in the game.
