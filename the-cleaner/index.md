{{ABOUT}}

The Cleaner was made by a group of three for a fictional, three-button handheld console as a Game Platform Analysis project for George Mason University in the Spring of 2019.

### Enemy Attacks

I made a scalable, animation-based system for attacks that allowed us to implement a variety of different attack types quickly and easily.

### Defending Yourself

As we had to work around the constraints of the handheld only having three buttons, I used this as a source of creativity and made each of them provide a different defense:

- **Left:** Catch projectiles from above with a bucket over your head
- **Right:** Catch projectiles heading straight towards you in a bucket  
- **Action:** Jump to avoid an attack

### Performing Strong Attacks

To reward players for defending against an attack, I made catching enemy particles fill a power meter at the top of the screen. When the meter fills up, the power of their next attack increases.
