{{ABOUT}}

Winder Walkers was created as an entry for [Brackeys Jam 2020.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-4) by a team of four. Of 1,803 entries, it came in 33rd overall.

### Winding Down

As the game jam's theme was "rewind", I opted for us to make clockwork energy be the game's central mechanic. Each walker has a limited amount, so players must conserve it by carrying each other, splitting up to complete tasks, and keeping an eye out for wind-up stations to "rewind".

### Making Mechanisms

To allow for more creativity and modularity in our level design, I made a collection of mechanisms for the team to use, each sharing an underlying script that allows for buttons, levers, and wind-up mechanisms to be used interchangeably to open doors and move platforms.

### A Little Pick-Me-Up

To allow for more inter-walker interaction, I created mechanics that allow them to help each other out. When more direct assistance is needed, walkers can approach their partner to wind them back up directly.
